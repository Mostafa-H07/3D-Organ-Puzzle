# 🎮🧩 3D Anatomy Puzzle Game: A Hands-On Learning Experience 
<br>

## Overview

Together with my talented team, we created an interactive 3D puzzle game centered around human anatomy! Our goal was to make learning about the body’s organs and anatomy an interactive experience.

Here’s how we approached it:
- **Organ Selection**: We started by choosing a specific organ to focus on, aiming for one that would capture interest and provide clear educational value.
- **Detailed 3D Modeling**: Using Blender 3D, we built a realistic 3D model of the organ, ensuring it had all the intricate details necessary for an accurate representation.
- **Game Development in Unity**: Within just two weeks, we developed the 3D puzzle game in Unity. This involved segmenting the 3D model into 5 pieces, each randomized in both position and orientation, and setting it up so players could pick up and manipulate each piece to reassemble the organ.
- **Interactive Controls**: We implemented user-friendly controls that allowed players to rotate, flip, and snap pieces together, making the game feel engaging and accessible to users of all ages.
- **Enhanced Visual Feedback**: To support learning, we color-coded the puzzle pieces and added alignment indicators that show when pieces fit correctly, improving the experience and ensuring that users get immediate feedback.

The result? A unique, hands-on anatomy puzzle that challenges users’ spatial skills while enhancing their understanding of the organ’s structure. By bringing together modern game development techniques and educational content, this project transformed complex medical material into a learning tool that anyone can engage with.
